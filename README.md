# TMC2209_sensorless_homing_test
A simple code using the [TMCStepper](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/tmc-stepper) and [AccelStepper](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/accel-stepper) library to test the sensor-less homing feature of the TMC2209 stepper driver. Both libraries can be found in Arduino IDE's library manager.
It is set up to home two stepper motors, you can uncomment the functions motorAHome() or motorBHome() to just test a single motor.
